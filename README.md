# ArgusNet: A Comprehensive Blockchain Watcher

## Overview

ArgusNet began as a concise implementation of the [Alchemy-SDK](https://www.alchemy.com/sdk) for the [Alchemy University](https://university.alchemy.com) ETH Bootcamp Web 3 project. Captivated by the subject, I chose to expand upon it, enhancing its capabilities and incorporating additional features. The current version provides fundamental functionalities, enabling users to trace transactions across the blockchain.

## Key Features

-   **Robust Transaction Tracking**: Easily trace any transaction throughout the blockchain.

## Upcoming Features

### Enhanced Security Measures

-   The forthcoming update will prioritize data validation and error handling to bolster data accuracy and integrity.
-   The system will be designed to ensure resilience, especially concerning API call failures.

### Versatile User Interfaces

Given that blockchain explorers often present information in a dense and complex manner, ArgusNet aims to cater to various user needs by offering multiple tailored interfaces:

-   **Simple User Mode**: Streamlined information, tailored for the average user with explanations.
-   **Developer Mode**: Direct access to raw data, execution logs, and tools for data interpretation.
-   **Trader Mode**: Integrated tools for real-time price analysis and data manipulation with intuitive user interactions.
-   **Tracker Mode**: A dedicated interface for fund tracking and monitoring across the blockchain.
